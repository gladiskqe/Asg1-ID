I-dle's website
the user audience intent and purpose is to allow user to learn more about I-dle's rebrand and why. 
It also allows users to buy concert tickets and merchandise all in one website, which makes it easier for new fans.
In addition to that, I made a members page that gives some funfacts about the memebers.

The website is catering for I-dle's fans, both new and old. For new audience they can learn more about their music and their style while older fans can purchase merchandise and tickets. This provides them with great convenience as it is a all in one website.

This website allows both the band and the fans to sell and buy the tickets and merchandise all in one website. This is very useful as they dont need to overcross to other website(3rd party eg. TicketMaster) to purchase the concert which might add on some addition charges.

Design Process
This website is for I-dle's fan to learn more about them and their music and their history as a group. In this, I showed some new combacks, and awards the group has won recently and also some funfacts about the members. To add on, you can purchase concert tickets and merchandise. It bring the simplicity and convinence for both sides as its within one website.
